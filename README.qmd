```{r}
#| label: install-packages
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}
pkgs = c(
  "sf",
  "osmextract",
  "tidyverse",
#   "spanishoddata",
  "od",
  "simodels",
  "zonebuilder",
  "tmap"
)
```

Install the packages as follows:

```{r}
#| label: install-packages-2
#| eval: false
pak::pak(pkgs, upgrade = FALSE)
```

We'll load the packages as follows:

```{r}
purrr::walk(pkgs, library, character.only = TRUE)
```

We'll also install the `osmactive` package:

```{r}
pak::pak("nptscot/osmactive")
```

And let's switch tmap to interactive plotting mode:

```{r}
tmap_mode("view")
```

We'll use the `osmextract` package to download OpenStreetMap data for St Andrews. Set the `osmextract` download directory if it's not already set.

```{r}
# ?oe_download_directory
# usethis::edit_r_environ()
Sys.getenv("OSMEXT_DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY")
```

Let's get a polygon representing St Andrews and its surroundings

```{r}
#| label: st-andrews-polygon
# Radius of circles is 1, 3, 6, 10 km
st_andrews_zones = zb_zone("St Andrews", n_circles = 4)
names(st_andrews_zones)
st_andrews_zones = st_andrews_zones |>
  select(label, circle_id, segment_id)
plot(st_andrews_zones)
```

Let's check the zones are in the right place with an interactive plot:

```{r}
#| label: st-andrews-zones-interactive
#| eval: false
tm_shape(st_andrews_zones) +
  tm_polygons("circle_id", alpha = 0.3)
```

![](images/clipboard-855988838.png)

```{r}
st_andrews_region = sf::st_union(st_andrews_zones)
st_andrews_osm = oe_get("Scotland", boundary = st_andrews_region, boundary_type = "clipsrc")
```

```{r}
st_andrews_osm |> 
  sf::st_geometry() |>
  plot()
```

We can get more specific bits of OSM with the `osmextract` package as follows:

# Challenges

## Challenge 1: Obtaining population data for St Andrews

1. Obtain population estimates from the 2021 Census at the small area level and download them onto your computer
1. Import them into R
1. Download and import corresponding boundary data
1. Subset the the census population data to the St Andrews study area 
1. Join the population data with the boundary data
1. Plot the total number of people living in each administrative zone in the surroundings of St Andrews
1. Plot the population density in each administrative zone in the surroundings of St Andrews
1. Use a spatial join function (e.g. `st_join()` in `sf` or `sjoin()` in `geopandas`) to join the population data with the `st_andrews_zones` dataset and plot the results

## Challenge 2: Getting trip attractors for St Andrews

1. Generate, explore and describe a dataset representing trip attractors in and around St Andrews

```{r}
osm_points = oe_get(
  "Scotland",
  boundary = st_andrews_region,
  layer = "points"
)
plot(osm_points)
st_andrews_n_points = osm_points |>
  sf::st_join(st_andrews_zones) |>
  sf::st_drop_geometry() |>
  group_by(label) |>
  summarise(
    n_points = n()
  )
st_andrews_ze = left_join(
  st_andrews_zones,
  st_andrews_n_points
) 
st_andrews_ze |>
  select(n_points) |> 
  plot()
```

## Challenge 3: Generate and explore spatial interaction models for St Andrews

Run the code below, play with the inputs and try to generate a more realistic SIM (see the documentation for the `simodels` R package)

```{r}
od = simodels::si_to_od(
  origins = st_andrews_ze,
  destinations = st_andrews_ze
)
plot(od)
```

```{r}
names(od)
summary(od)
```

```{r}
gravity_model = function(beta, d, m, n) {
  m * n * exp(-beta * d / 1000)
} 
# perform SIM
od_res = si_calculate(
  od,
  fun = gravity_model,
  d = distance_euclidean,
  m = origin_n_points,
  n = destination_n_points,
  beta = 1.5
)
```

```{r}
od_res |> 
  select(interaction) |> 
  arrange(interaction) |>
  plot(logz = TRUE, lwd = log(od_res$interaction))
```

## Challenge 4: Downloading large OD datasets with `spanishoddata` R package

Check out the documentation of the package and try to download some data showing

- Flows between Madrid and Barcelona
- Flow between Madrid and Valencia
- Flows between Barcelona and Valencia

Which has the most flows?

Come up with some research questions and explore them
